# embeded_languages_p1
<p>In this project, there will be three parts to analyze pandas. First part will be Grammar for pandas library. Second part will implement an algorithm to identify if the input is vaild DataFrame structure. Third part will be the cost analysis of DataFrame and type of the parameter .
 
<p>First part will be BNF that the pandas follow. It might be not completed but enough to do the following analysis
<p>In second part, we as AST.nodevisitor to trace all node and then to identify if the statement or expression is a value syntax to constuct or create a valid dataframe
<p>In Thrid part, the first section is a simple anaylsis of parameter type that you pass in to the DataFrame constructure.
 The second section, approximately calculate the memory that might take for a certain vaild DataFrame.
